_The Safety Patrol_ by Bisa Butler, 2018



Bray, S. (2020). Implementing Cryptography Using Python. Wiley and Sons, Inc. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This book is perfect for applying the high-level knowledge one typically gets
when learning about cryptography. Typical cybersecurity courses provide information
about the algorithms, like which ones are commonly used and their (often simplified)
structure. 

As someone who has covered cryptographic concepts in most my masters coursework,
I can say that the threshold to feel "above" a beginner is intense. This book
could help get over that barrier.

It begins with an intro to cryptography concepts that can largely be skimmed if 
you've any prior experience, though it's always wise to review and reinforce.
Likewise, it also begins with an overview of Python that can be used if you're 
feeling like you lack the knowledge to understand the program files themselves.

The final chapter allows the reader to construct an app that can either send 
plaintext messages, or encrypt messages using "asymmetric PKI and using the 
symmetric key method with an ECDH key exchange" (p. 247). It's quite the task,
but definitely one that let's you exercise your cryptographic muscles. 

Or at least I think it is, I haven't gotten that far yet. 

Thanks to Shannon Bray for the excellent book.
